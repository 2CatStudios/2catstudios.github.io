                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Inspired by Mayori Sekijima's <i>Phi Brain</i>, Orpheus Order SPuzzle (Slider Puzzle) is an enticing multiplayer puzzle challenge, where players contend to end their turn on the middle tile of our game board, with their only moves being equivalent to those of Chess' Castle.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the trials imposed by your competitor may be tough, Orpheus Order SPuzzle provides an engaging way to expand your mental prowess, as well as fully-featured, real-time statistics and a complete history of your moves, should you want to review a match.</P>
                
                    <p>The rules are simple, but the entertainment is pure, and the challenge is genuine.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h3>Orpheus Order SPuzzle features all of the following:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engaging Puzzles</li>
                    <li>Simple Gameplay</li>
                    <li>Deep Statictics for Every Game</li>
                    <li>Stylized User-Interface to Match Theme</li>
                    <li>Straightforward Multiplayer with no Hastle</li>
                    <li>Noise-Free Expirence to Promote Concentration</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Please take a moment to examine the game-in-progress bellow. You can clearly see most of the aspects discussed above, and perhaps you'll identify Blue's chance at a victory- and what Red can do to turn the tides.</p>

                <p>Does the stock-market seem like a worthwhile venture? Could Wallstreet be the way to your fortune? Does risking millions of dollars sound like a fun time? For all the aspiring brokers and businessmen out there, we made this. Test your skills in the market, and see if you have what it takes to become independently-wealthy via the volatile and rewarding world of investments.</p>
                <P>(That was completely PR gibberish- this "game" is not worth playing.)</p>
