			<p>2Cat Studios is a two <del>cat</del> man computer-software development team, writing code, and playing with yarn. They formed in 2012, although they were informally working together long before that. Their first major project, <a href="unitymusicplayer.html">UnityMusicPlayer</a>, has been in development since the inception of the studio, and has seen many changes and improvements over the years. It has garnished the attention of many indie-music artists from around the industry, and has greatly benefited from the suggestions of users and fans. 2Cat Studios is in active development on a few other projects, and their progress can be monitored on each respective project's page.</p>

There, you can keep up with the latest movements of the team, find insights to their daily life, and uncover all of their <del>hairbrained</del> crazy schemes<br>("2Cat Studications"? What was I thinking?). For more specific information on the individual members, see the bios and portraits  bellow.</p>

                <h2>Bethke, Michael</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the resident black cat here at 2Cat Studios. I handle the main C# programming, as well as Macintosh deployment, and website development. I write the (always on time) <a href="news+blog.html">News+Blog</a> posts, retweet pictures of cats and architecture on my <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelBethke">Twitter</a>, and make very abstract music for release on UMP and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/blacktie-vivid">Soundcloud</a>.</p>

                <h2>Heemstra, Jan</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Jan, and I tend to not do a lot of things. You know, good mathematicians are lazy. Also, I tend to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/combustible-lemonade">music</a> a lot. So I do do that. But that's not mathematics, so it's OK, I guess.</p>
