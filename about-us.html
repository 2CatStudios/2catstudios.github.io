            <p>2Cat Studios is a two <del>man</del> cat computer-software development team, writing code, and enjoying their craft. They formed in Q4, 2012, although they were informally working together long before that. Their first major project, <a href="unitymusicplayer.html">UnityMusicPlayer</a>, has been in development since the inception of the studio, and has seen many changes and improvements over the years. It has garnished the attention of many indie-music artists from the industry, and has greatly benefited from the suggestions of users and fans. 2Cat Studios is in active development on a few projects, and their progress can be monitored on the respective projects page.</p>
            
            <p>For a more general idea of the group's activities, visit the <a href="/news+blog.html">News+Blog</a> page, where time flys more slowly. You may also take a moment to reflect on the fleetingness of life on their <a href="404.html">404</a> page, where time seems to be missing (perhaps it never was?). Basically, the concept of a perpetually flowing life is lost on these two, as they spend their days lounging in the sun, sleeping on keyboards, and missing deadlines. They didn't actually hire anyone to write this, it's just in third-person because that sounds more professional, right?</p>
