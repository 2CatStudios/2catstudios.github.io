                <h2>Currently in Development, Version 0.01</h2>
                    
                <p>TradingCard Game will be a multiplayer card game, with a focus on tactics and strategy, rather than having the strongest cards. The core elements of the game are subterfuge and misdirection, and it's fundamental mechanics are very simple, which should allow for anyone to have a good time playing, whether they're new to TCGs, or are long-time veterans. To keep the game entertaining, even for our most loyal players, the game features many aspects which can't be predicted; players can make pre-game strategies via building their "Minor Deck", but the majority of their cards during a game come from a "Major Deck", which is generated at the start of each new game. This allows for some level of planning, but for players to truly become skilled, they must learn to adapt, and develop tatics on the fly. Other, non-player-controlled elements also affect gameplay, and add a lasting appeal, but we'll talk more about that later.</p>
                
                <p>We are still early in development, but we're excited to announce much more, very soon. Please check back here for more information, and don't forget to let us know what you think, via the email provided bellow.</p>
