                <h2>Development Indefinitely Postponed</h2>
                    
                <p>TradingCard Game was to be a multiplayer card game, with a focus on tactics and strategy, rather than having the strongest cards. The core elements of the game were subterfuge and misdirection, and it's fundamental mechanics were very simple. The straightforward gameplay and design would allow for anyone to have a good time playing, whether they're new to TCGs, or are long-time veterans. To keep the game entertaining, even for our most loyal players, the game would features many aspects which can't be predicted; players can make pre-game strategies via building their "Minor Deck", but the majority of their cards during a game come from a "Major Deck", which is generated at the start of each new game. This allows for some level of planning, but for players to truly become skilled, they must learn to adapt, and develop tatics on the fly. Other, non-player-controlled elements also affect gameplay, and add a lasting appeal, but we'll talk more about that later (never, sorry).</p>
